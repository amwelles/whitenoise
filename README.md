Whitenoise is a very simple static site starter kit. I love using HAML and SASS, and I often create static sites long before I move onto the "real" thing to get an idea of the design. I use [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) to watch changes, but you can just as easily use the command line to watch HAML and SASS files.

It's designed to be used with [Pow](http://pow.cx/) for local development.
